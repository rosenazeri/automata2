"You can input any two arbitrary strings into the Turing machine, and it will output the longest common substring between them. Similarly, in an NPDA (Nondeterministic Pushdown Automaton), the grammar is converted into a language."
Refined Explanation (Optional):
• Turing Machine (LCS):
"The Turing machine solves the Longest Common Substring (LCS) problem-given two input strings, it computes the longest sequence of characters shared by both."
• NPDA & Grammar:
"An NPDA processes strings based on a formal grammar rules, effectively translating the grammar into an accepted language."
